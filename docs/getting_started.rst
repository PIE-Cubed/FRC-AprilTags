Getting Started
===============

RobotPy WPILib is a set of libraries that are used on your roboRIO to
enable you to use Python as your main programming language for FIRST Robotics
robot development. It includes support for almost all components that are
supported by WPILib's C++ implementation.

You can run RobotPy-based programs either on your computer or on a robot. There
are a lot of different ways you can get started with RobotPy, but we recommend
the following steps:

* :ref:`Install RobotPy on your computer <install_computer>`
* Learn how to write Python-based robot code via :ref:`anatomy` and the various
  sections of the :ref:`programmer's guide <programmers_guide>`

Once you've played around with some code in simulation, then you should 
:ref:`install RobotPy on your robot <install_robotpy>`.

If you're looking to use NetworkTables on the driver station or on a
coprocessor, then check out the :ref:`pyntcore install docs <install_pyntcore>`.
